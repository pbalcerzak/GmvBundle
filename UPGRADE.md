# UPGRADE FROM 1.0 TO 1.1

1. Support for Symfony 8 has been added. It currently requires Sylius `2.3.x-dev`, as no stable Sylius release
   supports Symfony 8 yet.

1. Support for Symfony 5.4, PHP 8.1 and Sylius 1.14 has been dropped. The minimum requirements are now PHP 8.2
   and Sylius 2.0.

1. The `config/services.xml` file has been replaced with `config/services.php`. If you imported it directly
   (instead of relying on `SyliusGmvExtension`), update the path accordingly.

# UPGRADE FROM 0.2 TO 1.0

1. Support for Sylius 2.0 has been added.

1. Support for Sylius 1.12 and 1.13 have been dropped.

1. The `GmvCommand` console command has been moved from `Command` to `Console\Command` and changed its namespace
   accordingly from `Sylius\GmvBundle\Command\GmvCommand` to `Sylius\GmvBundle\Console\Command\GmvCommand`. 
   The service ID has been also changed from `sylius_gmv.command.gmv` to `sylius_gmv.console.command.gmv`. 

# UPGRADE FROM 0.1 TO 0.2

1. Support for Sylius 1.14 has been added, it is now the recommended Sylius version to use with GmvPlugin.
